Overview

The UMCP VSA Family Trees project is an innovative web application enabling users to navigate through various family trees. It features dynamic, zoomable visualizations of family branches and provides a search function to effortlessly find specific members by name.

Technologies Used

This project is built on a diverse tech stack for both front-end presentation and back-end data management:

Front-end:
HTML: Structures the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual elements for a user-friendly experience.
JavaScript (JS): Adds interactivity to the web application.
D3.js: Generates dynamic, interactive data visualizations in the web browser.
Back-end:
Java API: Utilizes RESTful endpoints with Spring Boot for server-side logic.
Gradle: Manages dependencies and builds the Java project.
Data Management:
Google Forms: Collects member data.
Google Sheets API: Stores the form submissions in an organized manner.
Deployment:
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Hosts the application using App Engine, ensuring scalability and reliability.
Node.js: Serves the front-end website, interfacing with the Java API to fetch family tree data.

How It Works

Data Collection: Members submit their information through a Google Form.
Data Storage: Submissions are automatically stored in Google Sheets.
Back-end Processing: A Java API reads the data from Google Sheets, organizes it into family trees, and provides RESTful endpoints for data access.
Front-end Visualization: The website fetches the tree data and uses D3.js to render interactive, dynamic family tree visualizations.
User Interaction: Users can explore the family trees, zoom in/out, and search for specific members by name.
